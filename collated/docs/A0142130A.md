#### Remember the Milk
**Pros:**<br>
1. Can be used offline and tasks are synced once internet connection is established<br>
2. Can handle some natural language processing by saving deadlines from task information itself (e.g. Do math homework tomorrow: Saves task with deadline set to tomorrow)<br>
3. Can undo when marking tasks as done (recover from accidentally marking a task as done)<br>
4. Can set priority, and list tasks by priority<br>
5. Can set recursive tasks<br>

**Cons:**<br>
1. Need to click frequently to enter or edit a task<br>
2. Need to remember lots of shortcuts, so user is less likely to use them<br>
3. Has a cluttered interface, which is not intuitive<br>
4. Does not support calendar view in-house<br>

#### Showing calendar view : `calendar` or `cal`
You can view the calendar for the week on the right panel to refer to the dates and any events scheduled 
when adding tasks and scheduling events.<br>

#### Saving the information in Taskell : `save`
You can specify the path of a folder to store Taskell's data file. Please note that you should have permissions to access the folder. <br>
