## Introduction
Are you having a hard time remembering all the work you have to do? Do you have trouble finding a task manager that suits your preference for keyboard input? Well, worry no more, Taskell is here for you! <br>
Taskell will be your personal secretary. It will keep track of your daily tasks and remind you of any important dates and deadlines. What distinguishes Taskell from other task managers is that Taskell only requires a single line of command for every task input. This means that you can record each one of your tasks with just a single statement. You will no longer have to use a mouse if you do not wish to. <br>
