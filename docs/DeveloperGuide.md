##Introduction

Taskell is a simple software for users to keep track of their daily tasks and manage their busy schedule. Keyboard lovers will be able to experience the full benefit of Taskell as it implements a command-line interface.

This developer guide will help you understand the design and implementation of Taskell. It helps you understand how Taskell works and how you can contribute for further development. This guide follows a top-down approach by giving an overview of the essential components first, followed by thorough explanation subsequently.

## Setting Up

#### Prerequisites

1. **JDK `1.8.0_60`**  or later<br>

    > Having any Java 8 version is not enough. <br>
    This app will not work with earlier versions of Java 8.
    
2. **Eclipse** IDE
3. **E(fx)clipse** plugin for Eclipse (Do the steps 2 onwards given in
   [this page](http://www.eclipse.org/efxclipse/install.html#for-the-ambitious))
4. **Buildship Gradle Integration** plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace


#### Importing the Project into Eclipse

0. Fork this repository, and clone the fork to your computer
1. Open Eclipse (Note: Ensure you have installed the **e(fx)clipse** and **buildship** plugins as given in the prerequisites above)
2. Click `File` > `Import`
3. Click `Gradle` > `Gradle Project` > `Next` > `Next`
4. Click `Browse`, then locate the project's directory
5. Click `Finish`

  > * If you are asked whether to 'keep' or 'overwrite' configuration files, choose to 'keep'.
  > * Depending on your connection speed and server load, it can even take up to 30 minutes for the set up to finish
      (This is because Gradle downloads library files from servers during the project set up process)
  > * If Eclipse auto-changed any settings files during the import process, you can discard those changes.
  
#### Troubleshooting project setup

**Problem: Eclipse reports compile errors after new commits are pulled from Git**
* Reason: Eclipse fails to recognize new files that appeared due to the Git pull. 
* Solution: Refresh the project in Eclipse:<br> 
  Right click on the project (in Eclipse package explorer), choose `Gradle` -> `Refresh Gradle Project`.
  
**Problem: Eclipse reports some required libraries missing**
* Reason: Required libraries may not have been downloaded during the project import. 
* Solution: [Run tests using Gradle](UsingGradle.md) once (to refresh the libraries).
 

## Design

### Architecture

<p align="center">
<img src="images/Architecture.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Diagram 1: Architecture Diagram</em>
</p>

The Architecture Diagram given above explains the high-level design of the Application.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.<br>

`Main` has only one class called [`MainApp`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At application launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
Two of those classes play important roles at the architecture level.
* `EventsCentre` : Used by components to communicate with other components using events (i.e. a form of _Event Driven_ design)(written using [Google's Event Bus library](https://github.com/google/guava/wiki/EventBusExplained))

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the Application's log file.

The rest of the Application consists five components.
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component) : UI of the Application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component) : Command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component) : Data Holder of the Application in-memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component) : Data read from, and written to the hard disk.
* [**`History`**](#history-component) : Data holder of Application's command history (for undo only).

Each of the five components
* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Diagram 2: Logic Class Diagram</em>
</p>

The `Logic` component above defines it's API in the `Logic.java`
interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.<br>

<p align="center">
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTask.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Diagram 3: Sequence Diagram for Delete Task</em>
</p>

The Sequence Diagram above shows how the components interact for the scenario where the user issues the
command `delete 1`.

>Note how the `Model` simply raises a `TaskManagerChangedEvent` when the Task Manager data is changed,
 instead of asking the `Storage` to save the updates to the hard disk.

<p align="center">
<img src="images\SDforDeleteTaskEventHandling.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Diagram 4: Sequence Diagram for Delete Task Event Handling</em>
</p>

The diagram above shows how the `EventsCenter` reacts to that event, which eventually results in the updates
being saved to the hard disk. The status bar of the UI is updated to reflect the 'Last Updated' time. <br>

> Note how the event is propagated through the `EventsCenter` to the `Storage` and `UI` without `Model` having
  to be coupled to either of them. This is an example of how this Event Driven approach helps us reduce direct 
  coupling between components.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

<p align="center">
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Diagram 5: UI Class Diagram </em>
</p>

The diagram above gives an overview of how the `UI`component is implemented.<br>

**API** : [`Ui.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`,
`StatusBarFooter`, `BrowserPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class
and they can be loaded using the `UiPartLoader`.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
 that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.<br>
 For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in
 [`MainWindow.fxml`](../src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,
* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Binds itself to some data in the `Model` so that the UI can auto-update when data in the `Model` changes.
* Responds to events raised from various parts of the Application and updates the UI accordingly.
* Uses [Agenda API](http://jfxtras.org/doc/8.0/jfxtras-agenda/index.html) from JFXtras to display calendar view with task events.

### Logic Component

<p align="center">
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Diagram 6: Logic Class Diagram </em>
</p>

The diagram above gives an overview of how the `Logic` component is implemented.<br>
<br>**API** : [`Logic.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/logic/Logic.java)

The `Logic` component,
* Uses the `Parser` class to parse the user command, resulting in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
* Affects the `Model` (e.g. adding a task) and/or raise events.
* Executes the necessary command and the result is encapsulated as a  `CommandResult` to be passed back to the `UI`.

### Model Component

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Diagram 9: Model Class Diagram </em>
</p>

The diagram above gives an overview of how the `Model` component is implemented.<br>
<br>**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Manager data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyTask>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Storage Component

<p align="center">
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="800"><br>

<em>Diagram 10: Storage Class Diagram </em>
</p>

The diagram above gives an overview of how the `Storage` component is implemented.<br>
<br>**API** : [`Storage.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Task Manager data in xml format and read it back.

### History Component

<p align="center">
<img src="images/HistoryClassDiagram.png" width="500"><br>

<em>Diagram 11: History Class Diagram </em>
</p>

The diagram above gives an overview of how the `History` component is implemented.<br>
<br>**API** : [`History.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/taskell/model/History.java)

The `History` component,
* stores the commands that UndoCommand can execute (add/delete/done/undone/edit)
* exposes list of command input strings for UI display
* updates list of command history every time a command is executed

<!--- @@author --->

### Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taskmanager.commons` package.

## Implementation

### Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels
and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file
  (See [Configuration](#configuration))
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to
  the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

**Logging Levels**

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Program can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the Application
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging
  e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

### Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g Application name, logging level) through the configuration file 
(default: `config.json`) <br>
To reset properties in the configuration file, delete `config.json` and run Taskell again.


## Testing

Tests can be found in the `./src/test/java` folder.

**In Eclipse**:
* To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose
  `Run as` > `JUnit Test`
* To run a subset of tests, right-click on a test package, test class, or a test and choose
  to run as a JUnit test.

**Using Gradle**:
* See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) for how to run tests using Gradle.

We have two types of tests:

1. **GUI Tests** - These are _System Tests_ that test the entire Application by simulating user actions on the GUI. 
   These are in the `guitests` package.
  
2. **Non-GUI Tests** - These are tests not involving the GUI. They include,
   1. _Unit tests_ targeting the lowest level methods/classes. <br>
      e.g. `seedu.taskell.model.task.TaskDateTest`
   2. _Integration tests_ that are checking the integration of multiple code units 
     (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
      e.g. `seedu.taskell.storage.StorageManagerTest`
   3. Hybrids of unit and integration tests. These tests are checking multiple code units as well as 
      how the are connected together.<br>
      e.g. `seedu.taskell.logic.LogicManagerTest`
  
**Headless GUI Testing** :
Thanks to the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library we use,
 our GUI tests can be run in the headless mode. 
 In the headless mode, GUI tests do not show up on the screen.
 That means the developer can do other things on the Computer while the tests are running.<br>
 See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md#running-tests) to learn how to run tests in headless mode.
 
#### Troubleshooting tests
 **Problem: Tests fail because NullPointException when AssertionError is expected**
 * Reason: Assertions are not enabled for JUnit tests. 
   This can happen if you are not using a recent Eclipse version (i.e. _Neon_ or later)
 * Solution: Enable assertions in JUnit tests as described 
   [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2522897/eclipse-junit-ea-vm-option). <br>
   Delete run configurations created when you ran tests earlier.
  
## Dev Ops

### Build Automation

See [UsingGradle.md](UsingGradle.md) to learn how to use Gradle for build automation.

### Continuous Integration

We use [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) to perform _Continuous Integration_ on our projects.
See [UsingTravis.md](UsingTravis.md) for more details.

### Making a Release

Here are the steps to create a new release.
 
 1. Generate a JAR file [using Gradle](UsingGradle.md#creating-the-jar-file).
 2. Tag the repository with the version number. e.g. `v0.1`
 2. [Create a new release using GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) 
    and upload the JAR file your created.
   
### Managing Dependencies

A project often depends on third-party libraries. For example, Taskell depends on the
[Jackson library](http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome) for XML parsing. Managing these _dependencies_
can be automated using Gradle. For example, Gradle can download the dependencies automatically, which
is better than these alternatives.<br>
a. Include those libraries in the repository (this bloats the repository size)<br>
b. Require developers to download those libraries manually (this creates extra work for developers)<br>
