* This is a desktop task manager application. It has a GUI but most of the user interactions happen using 
  a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is a Java application built by Team Autumn, a team of students learning Software Engineering, using Java as 
  the main programming language. 
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code example that is 
  **significantly bigger** (around 6 KLoC)than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules.
